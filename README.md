# profit_loss
This code is a Python program designed to help a user calculate the profit or loss made on selling an item, along with the profit percentage. The program consists of several functions that handle different tasks such as taking input from the user, validating the input, and performing calculations. 
Here is a description of each function and the overall program:

Function: item

This function prompts the user to enter the name of an item and returns the entered item name.
Function: item_cost_price

This function prompts the user to enter the cost price of the item. It ensures that the input is a positive number. If the user enters a valid number, it converts it to a float and returns it; otherwise, it continues to prompt the user until a valid input is provided.
Function: item_sell_price

Similar to the item_cost_price function, this function prompts the user to enter the sell price of the item. It ensures that the input is a positive number. If the user enters a valid number, it converts it to a float and returns it; otherwise, it continues to prompt the user until a valid input is provided.
Function: profit

This function takes the cost price and sell price as arguments. It calculates the profit or loss by comparing the sell price with the cost price. It then prints the profit amount if the sell price is higher, the loss amount if the sell price is lower, or a message indicating no profit and no loss if the prices are equal.
Function: profit_percentage

This function takes the cost price and sell price as arguments. If there is a profit (i.e., the sell price is higher than the cost price), it calculates the profit percentage and prints it.
Function: main

This is the main function that orchestrates the flow of the program. It calls the item function to get the item name, the item_cost_price function to get the cost price, and the item_sell_price function to get the sell price. It then calls the profit and profit_percentage functions to calculate and display the profit or loss and the profit percentage, respectively.
Program Execution

The program starts execution from the main function when the script is run directly (i.e., not imported as a module). It collects the necessary inputs from the user and performs the required calculations to provide the profit or loss and profit percentage.
In summary, this program is an interactive tool for calculating the financial outcome of selling an item based on user-provided cost and sell prices.
